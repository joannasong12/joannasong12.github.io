## Description
- The API I chose to use was a database of census tracts in PG County, with information on each one including population numbers for different races
- Link to API Website: https://data.princegeorgescountymd.gov/Community/Census-Tracts/jkwh-e4vd
- Link to JSON: https://data.princegeorgescountymd.gov/resource/jkwh-e4vd.json
- The visualization I used was a chart that would display the racial distribution of whatever tract ID number the user inputs in the input box
- The chart is created using Chart.js
- The project displays the racial distribution of different tracts of PG County for people to find areas of culturally significance to them
